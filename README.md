# Cybersecurity Entry level Interview Questions #

### What is phishing?  ###

Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers pose as legitimate entities to trick users into providing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers. Phishing attacks are usually carried out via email, instant messaging...Etc.

### What is a firewall?

A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks. Basically it preventing unauthorized access and protecting the system from cyber threats.


### What do you mean by Network Sniffing?
Network sniffing is the process of monitoring and capturing data packets that pass through a network. Attackers use network sniffers to intercept sensitive information, like login credentials or private conversations.


### What is cipher text?
Cipher text is encrypted data that appears as random characters and is unreadable without the correct decryption key. When information is encrypted, it is converted from plain text to cipher text.

### What is encryption?

Encryption is the process of converting plain text into cipher text using an algorithm and encryption key. The purpose of encryption is to protect the confidentiality of data.

### What is decryption?
Decryption is the process of converting encrypted cipher text back into its original plain text form. Decryption requires the use of a decryption key. This process ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users.

### What is cryptography?
Cryptography is the practice of securing communication. Cryptography includes encryption, decryption, and digital signatures, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity [CIA] of data.


### What is multi-factor authentication?
Multi-factor authentication is a mechanism in which it requires users to provide more than one form of authentication factor, such as something they know, something they have, and something they are. Ex:  username/password + OTP   and username/password + Fingerprint biometric

 
### Explain Vulnerability, Risk and Threat

Vulnerability: Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source. (src: NIST)

Risk: The level of impact on agency operations (including mission functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals resulting from the operation of an information system given the potential impact of a threat and the likelihood of that threat occurring. (src: NIST)

Threat: Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through a system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service.
